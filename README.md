Hi there!

This project is for non-commercial purposes. I'm still working on it and this is just a little idea of the project.

This is the Netflify deployed link of the main branch: https://bookverse01.netlify.app/

This Lite branch is a simplified version of the main. Check it out: https://bookeverselite.netlify.app/

This project is a just an interesting experiment to let users easily seek titles through Open Library, The Internet Archive and The Library Of Congress all in one saerch engine. Its capabilities are still limited.

I'll update the code when I can, but feel free to contribute, or use it to find books or explore interesting titles.

Thanks for checking it out! Have fun and stay educated.
