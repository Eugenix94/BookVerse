Hi there!

This is the Netflify depoyed link: https://bookverse01.netlify.app/ 

Thanks for checking out this project. The scope of this project is to integrate all of the possible libraries so any user may find a local or digital copy of any book, anywhere, anytime. Thanks to the Library of Congress, I was able to fetch their book catalog, giving the first glimpse of physical book experience. 

This project is destined to become a PERN Stack app, once I had achieved other library APIs and having more future collaborations.

Anyway, I'll update the code when I can but feel free to contribute or already using it to find books online already.

Have fun and stay educated.
