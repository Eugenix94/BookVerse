Hi there!

This is the Netflify depoyed link: https://bookverse01.netlify.app/ 
I also made the Lite branch that's a simplified version of the main one. Check it out: https://bookeverselite.netlify.app/ 

This project is a just an interesting experiment just made to easily seek titles through Open Library, The Internet Archive and The Library Of Congress. 

Anyway, I'll update the code when I can, but feel free to contribute, or use it to find books or explore interesting titles.

Thanks for checking it out! 
Have fun and stay educated.
